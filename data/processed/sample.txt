Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. These tasks often involve complex statistical methods and deep learning models.

Modern NLP approaches have moved away from traditional rule-based systems toward machine learning methods. Deep learning models like transformers have revolutionized the field, enabling breakthroughs in machine translation, question answering, and text generation.

Large language models (LLMs) represent the cutting edge of NLP research. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, answer questions, summarize documents, and perform many other language-related tasks.

Building a custom language model from scratch involves understanding the architecture of neural networks, attention mechanisms, and training procedures. While challenging, this process provides valuable insights into how modern AI systems process and generate human language.
